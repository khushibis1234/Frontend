Semantic tags clearly describe their meaning and purpose in a way that is understandable to both developers and browsers. These tags make the structure of a webpage more readable and accessible.

Examples:

<header>: Represents the header of a webpage or a section.
<footer>: Represents the footer of a webpage or a section.
<article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content.
<section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content.
<nav>: Represents navigation links.
<main>: Represents the main content of a document.
Advantages:

Non-Semantic Tags
Definition: Non-semantic tags do not convey any meaning about their content and are generic containers for styling or layout purposes.

Examples:

<div>: A generic container with no specific meaning.
<span>: A generic inline container for text or elements.
Usage:

<div> is often used for grouping elements and applying CSS styling or JavaScript functionality.
<span> is used for styling or wrapping inline text without semantic meaning.
Drawbacks:

Lack of Meaning: Does not provide context about the content.
Accessibility Issues: Makes it harder for assistive technologies to understand the content.
SEO Limitations: Search engines may not interpret the content structure as effectively.
